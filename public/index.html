        <h1>Hi, my name is David Mitchell.</h1>
        <p id="landing-subtitle">I like to learn. </p>
        <p id="landing-description">Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a new graduate with a passion for software engineering
          and a strong desire grow this field. My goal is to build quality, and 
          effective applications to tackle real-world challenges. I am eager to dive deep into
          new technologies and continue learning!

        <h1>Hey, it's David!</h1>
        <p id="about-ppf">Past, Present, Future!</p>
        <p class="ppf-content">
          From a young age, I was fascinated by the technological wizardry of the smartphone world. 
          An early memory of mine is exploring the diverse features of my dad's iPhone, and it was then that 
          I discovered the limitless potential that lay within those numerous apps on the App Store. 
          The fascinating array of functionalities sparked a curiosity within me that was impossible to ignore. 
          I became driven by a desire to understand how these applications were built, thus paving my first steps 
          into the universe of coding.
        </p>

        <p class="ppf-content">
          Fast-forward to today, I'm a seasoned web and mobile developer, well-versed in Flutter, Swift, and Javascript, 
          with a particular affinity for enhancing user experience and interaction. My journey has also led me 
          to familiarize myself with key technologies like Docker, AWS, and Firebase. However, I believe in the 
          continuous growth and evolution of a developer, so I'm currently focused on expanding my horizons. 
          This includes diving deeper into software engineering best practices and exploring new, cutting-edge technologies.
          The goal is not only to stay current but also to anticipate and be ready for the future.
        </p>

        <p class="ppf-content">
          Looking ahead, my ambition is to craft software that transcends the boundaries of just functionality. 
          I aspire to create impactful software solutions that stand the test of time, with an emphasis on scalability 
          and enduring quality. I envision my coding journey to be one that makes a tangible difference in the world, 
          whether it's by solving complex problems or improving people's lives through technology. I’m excited about the 
          possibilities the future holds and can't wait to see where this adventure leads.
